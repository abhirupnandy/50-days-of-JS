# 50 days of JS

This is a repository for the 50 days of JS challenge. I will be posting my progress here. I will be using the book [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke as a
reference. I will also be using [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) as a reference.
